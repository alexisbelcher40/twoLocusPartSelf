# 2-locus SA with partial selfing

## Brief intro

Hey Crispin and Tim,

I have no idea if you guys will have any interest in using this repo, but I have created it mostly to make transferring code to NecTAR easier for myself. However, github can be a really great tool for collaborations as well.  Hope to hear from you soon.

# Consequences of genetic linkage for the maintenance of sexually antagonistic polymorphism in hermaphrodites

## Overview

This is the GitHub repository for the development of a two-locus model of sexually antagonistic selection in hermaphrodites. The resulting paper has been been published at *Evolution*, and is [available through the publisher](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.13120/full). You can also contact me directly if you would like a reprint. Here you can find all of the necessary code to reproduce the analyses and the pre-publication manuscript. The *Mathematica* `.nb` files where the models are developed are not tracked by git, but can be downloaded as an online appendix from the publisher website above (or contact me and I will be happy to provide if you don't have access to the appendices). Aside from the `.nb` files, all necessary code for creating the figures can be found in the `./R/functions-*.R` files.

## Reproducing the manuscript

The easiest way to reproduce the manuscript is to simply clone the repo, run createFigs.R, and then compile the manuscript file `doc/twoLocusPartSelf-v2-Clean.tex` using whatever default LaTeX editor/engine you have. 


## Contact & bug reporting

Please report any bugs, problems, or issues by opening an issue on the 2LocusPartSelf github [issues page](https://github.com/colin-olito/twoLocusPartSelf/issues). If you would like to report a bug/issue, and do not have a github account (and don't want to get one), please send a brief email detailing the problem you encountered to colin.olito at monash dot edu.

# Consequences of genetic linkage for the maintenance of sexually antagonistic polymorphism in hermaphrodites

## Overview

This is the GitHub repository for the development of a two-locus model of sexually antagonistic selection in hermaphrodites. The resulting paper has been accepted at *Evolution*, and is available through the publisher [here](link will be made available when possible). Here you can find all of the necessary code to reproduce the analyses and the manuscript of the paper. The *Mathematica* .nb files where the models are developed are not tracked by git, but all necessary results for creating the figures can be found in the `./R/functions-*.R` files.
